While brief, this notebook does build off the ideas presented in earlier notebooks on Electronic and Vibrational structure where we learned about setting up the Hamiltonian and calculating the ground state energy. The excitation energy calculations follow these similar methods so be sure to review those notebooks for clarification!"
