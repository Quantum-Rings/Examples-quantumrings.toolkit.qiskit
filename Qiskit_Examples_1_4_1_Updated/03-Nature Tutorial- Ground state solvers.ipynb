Since it is a chemistry standard, a factory is already available allowing a fast initialization of a VQE with UCC. The default is to use all single and double excitations. However, the excitation type (S, D, SD) as well as other parameters can be selected. We also preprend the `UCCSD` variational form with a `HartreeFock` initial state, which initializes the occupation of our qubits according to the problem which we are trying to solve.\n",

In this case, the `NumPyEigensolver` can take a filter function to return only the eigenstates with, for example, the correct number of particles. The function may act to give us only the information we want to know. This is of particular importance in the case of vibrational structure calculations where the true ground state of the Hamiltonian is the vacuum state. A default filter function to check the number of particles is implemented in the different problems and its use is shown in the cell below."
